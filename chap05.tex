\chapter{Framework implementation}

\section{Goals of implementation}

The main concerns upon implementing the framework were the following:

\begin{itemize}
	\item To separate the API from the selection logic
	\item To make the framework as extensible as possible
	\item To keep the framework overhead as low as possible
	\item To use the Scala language features to make the code simpler and easier to maintain
\end{itemize}
