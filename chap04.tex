\chapter{Performance evaluation}

The second core part of the library is the logic of performance evaluation of the functions that are combined together.

The process will be executed whenever the user invokes the function that was combined using the API described in %TODO: REFERENCE

The system in general needs to do the following steps upon invocation:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Locate the runtime history data of all the functions involved
	\item Select the function to be invoked
	\item Invoke the function and measure its runtime
	\item Update the runtime history data with the new record
\end{enumerate}

\section{Data obtained by measurement}

After invoking a function, we get the length of the run with high precision in nanoseconds.

Using available time to "obtain" more data
