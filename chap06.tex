\section{Problems with the practical use of the framework}

\subsection{Selection overhead}
\subsection{Maintainability}

One of the main problems that such a framework is facing in a real-life software system is an engineering problem. The code of today's systems has to be kept working and maintained for several years, sometimes decades. During this period, bugs appear in the system, business requirements change and consequently, it is necessary to perform changes and adaptations in function code.

Maintaining multiple implementations of the same functionality at once brings a lot of issues. The developers have to know exactly how all the implementations work and whenever it's necessary to modify the behavior, be able to perform changes in all of them to achieve the same result. Described process itself is very demanding and has a significant time impact on the development. 

What's more, subtle differences in behavior of the implementations could be unintentionally introduced. These differences might not have visible effects immediately and may appear after several other modifications. At that moment, it will be extremely difficult to locate the problem, because the misbehavior caused by it won't be deterministic thanks to the nature of the selection algorithm.

Using non-deterministic decision tools in general lowers the maintainability of the system.

\subsection{Debugging}

Discovering and fixing bugs in a software system is a key part of its development and maintenance process. It is a very complex and time consuming activity, and its complexity grows considerably for the bugs that have non-deterministic occurrences. Whenever there is a bug in one of the implementations used with the framework, it is inherently non-deterministic, as it has effect only when the specific implementation is selected.

\section{Implementation in other languages}

The framework is implemented in Scala and can be used by any JVM-based languages, even though often without the comfort that provides Scala with its implicits and eta-expansion.

The same functionality, however, could be used on other platform than JVM as well. The framework itself isn't complicated to reproduce and its runtime back-end is transferable to basically any platform. There would be minor complications with immutability of the data structures and expressiveness of Scala in some cases, but nothing show stopping.

The key part of the framework that would cause problems upon reimplementation is the API, which relies heavily on Scala's DSL features (see \ref{sec:dsls}). It requires the following features from the language:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Implicit type conversions
	\item Functions as first-class values
	\item Eta-expansion of methods
	\item Infix operator syntax for methods
	\item Macros to parse and modify the AST upon compilation
\end{itemize}

With a subset of the features in the language, a limited API can be designed. Let's have a look at some language examples and what they offer.

\subsection{Kotlin}

\subsection{Java}

\subsection{C\#}

The C\# language has relatively advanced features and offers function types (\inlinecode{Func<TArg, TRetVal>}) that allow treating the functions as first class values. There is also a feature called \textit{Method groups}, which, in certain situations, lead to an implicit conversion of a method on an object to the corresponding function type - basically the same as eta-expansion.

%TODO: Add examples

The API in C\# could be based on method chaining and be quite similar to the one in Scala, although the method name extraction and the infix fluent-language syntax wouldn't be present.
